## Project Overview

**NPL-Sentinel** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on **sentiment analysis** of consumer product reviews. While the models implemented here do not target maximum predictive accuracy, the main goal is to explore and apply NLP training techniques and methodologies to a realistic scenario‚Äîanalyzing consumer sentiments toward a smartphone product.

The name **NPL-Sentinel** conveys the idea of a "sentinel" continuously monitoring opinions to uncover trends and insights that drive informed decision-making.

---

## Objectives

1. **Sentiment Classification:** Identify whether a given product review is positive, neutral, or negative.
2. **Rating Correlation:** Examine the relationship between sentiment polarity and the consumers‚Äô numerical ratings.
3. **Exploratory Analysis:** Identify prominent words, entities, bigrams, trigrams, and patterns in textual data.
4. **Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of various models, including classical machine learning approaches, transformer-based models (BERT), and Large Language Models (LLMs) via In-Context Learning.

## Models and Approaches

- **SVM + Bag of Words (BoW):** Classic machine learning approach using simple text vectorization.
- **SVM + Embeddings (spaCy):** Using pre-trained Portuguese embeddings for semantic representation.
- **BERT (Fine-tuned):** Adapting a pre-trained BERT model (Portuguese) for sentiment classification.
- **In-Context Learning with LLMs:** Zero or few-shot classification using:
  - **OpenAI GPT-4o**
  - **Google Gemini**

---

## Data Description

The dataset consists of:

- **review:** A free-form text evaluation of the smartphone.
- **rating (1 to 5):** A numerical score reflecting consumer satisfaction.

From the rating, we derive sentiment labels as follows:

- Rating ‚â• 4 ‚Üí Positive
- Rating ‚â§ 2 ‚Üí Negative
- Rating = 3 ‚Üí Neutral

## Sample Data

Below are some example entries from the dataset (`reviews.csv`):

| review                                                                                   | rating |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| "O produto √© ok, nada demais. n√£o se destaca no mercado."                                | 3      |
| "Decepcionante, n√£o atendeu √†s expectativas."                                            | 1      |
| "N√£o tenho muito o que comentar, cumpre o que promete."                                  | 2      |
| "Gostei bastante, mas poderia ter mais funcionalidades."                                 | 4      |
| "Excelente servi√ßo, estou muito satisfeito porque atendeu todas as minhas expectativas." | 5      |

## Running the Project

This project is designed to run in **Google Colab**, not locally. Use the following placeholder link to open the notebook in Colab:

**[Run in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TpvhAvSCIUNvpEGziY5FV3MKKqE0u_5T?usp=sharing)**

Before running:

- Ensure that you have access to the necessary data files as described in the notebook.
- All required libraries are installed within the notebook.
- Generate and securely store your OpenAI and Google Gemini API keys as secrets in Google Colab.

## Results and Performance

### Classical & Neural Models (SVM, BERT)

| Model              | Accuracy | F1-Score |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| SVM + Bag of Words | 0.523013 | 0.477371 |
| SVM + Embeddings   | 0.539749 | 0.487158 |
| BERT               | 0.602510 | 0.580334 |

**Key Observation:**
Although not primarily focused on maximizing accuracy, BERT outperformed the SVM-based methods, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-Score among the tested models.

  - Paloma Corr√™a Alves (`pca2@cin.ufpe.br`)
  - Luciano Ayres Farias de Carvalho (`lafc@cin.ufpe.br`)

This project was developed as part of a **post-graduate** Deep Learning course at CIn - UFPE, under the supervision of Professor Luciano Barbosa.

**NPL-Sentinel** serves as a foundation for exploring and applying NLP techniques to a product-related sentiment analysis scenario. While high accuracy was not the main goal, these experiments provide a valuable learning experience and can be extended to other domains, languages, and more complex sentiment tasks.
